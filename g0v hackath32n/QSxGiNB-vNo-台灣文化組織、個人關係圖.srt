1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,460
其實我今天有點遲疑到底要不要提一個計畫

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,800
因為覺得這個計畫現在好像不是非常重要

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,800
可是還是提一下好了

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,800
就是這個計畫是

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,500
我忘了是什麼時候

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,300
就是我跟Best和Pogo有討論到的一個東西

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,300
那我之前幫

8
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,100
不是幫

9
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,600
我之前做過兩個跟GDP有關的藝術展覽

10
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,600
那其實有一些疑問

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,100
那所以現在的一個想法就是想要做出一個

12
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,800
台灣文化組織還有個人的關係圖

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,900
就是想要知道說政府的錢都補助到哪些機構上

14
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,300
然後這些機構都拿來辦什麼樣的展覽

15
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,700
然後邀請什麼樣的評審

16
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,000
然後邀請什麼樣的藝術家來展覽

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,800
就有點像之前Ronnie做過的台灣公司關係圖一樣

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,800
就想要知道這些人之間的關係

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,800
好

20
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,300
那

21
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,800
I can say this proposal in English myself

22
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,600
I want to do

23
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,000
I want to make a map of all the Taiwanese cultural institutions

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and creators and artists and judges and teachers

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
so that we know how our governments

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,200
how or where does our government funding go to

27
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,600
to which institutions and to which exhibitions and to which artists

28
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,800
so we can sort of better understand their relationship

29
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,200
and you know

30
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,000
find out like maybe the isolated parties

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
or find out like their structure of power

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and this project is not that important

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,700
so maybe you don't want to talk to me

34
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,500
because we have much more important things to do

35
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,200
than you know talking about art and cultural circles

36
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,800
but if you are interested talk to me

37
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:57,800
Thanks
