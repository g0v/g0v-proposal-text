1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
所以惠琦在上面的時候唱了一首歌

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
然後弄哭很多人

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
然後今天是來理性的呼籲行動對不對

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
然後好像上一次OSM的誰有來幫忙

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
那個Yellow Sword有來嗎

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
他好像有報名會來

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
所以應該有些人已經跳坑了

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
好來

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
My name is Patrick or Pat Khan

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And my project that I'd like to pitch is magic chat portals

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So the idea here, the problem that I experience

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Is that we like hanging out with people who are like us

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And so we form communities with people who are like us

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And now there are tools that are very user friendly

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And everyone can use them like Slack

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
But they're all kind of closed off

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And they're their own little world

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Where you're hanging out with the people who are like you

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So the idea is that to kind of create something

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Which already partly exists

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
That makes it so that someone who wants to work together

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Between communities in the digital spaces

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The homes where people already are

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Their own Slack teams, their own IRC channels

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Can anyone, whether they're technical or not

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Can create a portal that will let them work together

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Between communities just as easily as if you ran into someone

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
At a hackathon and started a conversation

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So there's not really much in this presentation

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's mostly just magic chat portals

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So the skills that I guess we would be looking for

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Is the technical skills, which are not the only ones

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's Go language, it's HTML and CSS

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
For making pretty user interfaces

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
To make it less technical

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But also documentation and most importantly

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
People who have communities in the city

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Or in Taiwan who are in their own places

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And if you would like to help connect them

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Then you would be a great example

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
To attempt to see if this will work for you

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So I think this is mostly it

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Thank you

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You're making universal translator

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yes

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Actually it does translate

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It translates between languages

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And that's part of helping people share space

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But it also just brings

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It lets people who are in other communities

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Talk easily without having to go to someone else's home

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
From their own home

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
They can kind of bridge chat channels

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So that all the messages go in between

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So that's the vision
