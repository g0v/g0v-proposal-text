1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,460
And when Mrs. Lee had given the idea to her son,

2
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,260
she had watched Mr. Ma along with the kids,

3
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,300
and she didn't...

4
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,660
She didn't see it coming,

5
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,620
but she just felt responsible.

6
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,360
She just wanted to do something big.

7
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,740
She told them she could do it.

8
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,660
She had this big job.

9
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,460
And she wanted to make sure that

10
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,400
they had something good for them.

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,740
And this is the key to the whole operation,

12
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,720
she didn't want bad stuff,

13
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,920
and so she pitched the idea himself.

14
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,920
and we are the National Assembly of the Republic of China.

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,920
The National Assembly of the Republic of China

16
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,920
was established a year ago,

17
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,920
in February last year.

18
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,920
At that time, as we all know,

19
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,920
President Gao said that today is

20
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,920
a large-scale demonstration in Nanjing, Hunan.

21
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,920
Of course, why is there a large-scale demonstration?

22
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,920
It is because of our excellent

23
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,920
member of the Senate,

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,920
and many outstanding

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,920
performances.

26
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,920
So we all know

27
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,920
that the Legislative Yuan has a lot of

28
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,920
things to do.

29
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,920
But we are not clear about what the Legislative Yuan

30
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,920
has been doing.

31
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,920
Every four years, we try to imagine

32
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,920
one thing.

33
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,920
We all know that the Legislative Yuan

34
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,920
will be elected in January next year.

35
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,920
If we try to imagine that you will

36
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,920
take two votes, one for the party,

37
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,920
one for the election,

38
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,920
who will I vote for?

39
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,920
I don't know who I will vote for.

40
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,920
The more powerful people may know

41
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,920
that the National Assembly of the Republic of China

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,920
is a big party.

43
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,920
But we will see what kind of

44
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,920
attendance records the Legislative Yuan has.

45
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,920
But I can't see what he said.

46
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,920
We may know that the National Assembly of the Republic of China

47
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,920
has a lot of things to do.

48
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,920
But I can't know which

49
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,920
Legislative Yuan has done

50
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,920
what he said.

51
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,920
So we try to solve this matter.

52
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,920
We try to build a

53
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,920
Legislative Yuan information database.

54
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,920
We all know that democracy is not giving,

55
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,920
but participating.

56
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,920
We all know that the people who

57
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,920
are doing these things are usually

58
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,920
others.

59
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,920
Is it possible that we can

60
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,920
try to do something ourselves?

61
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,920
We all know that we want to

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,920
reduce the threshold.

63
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,920
So we have a website.

64
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,920
This is the QR code.

65
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,920
You can scan it.

66
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,920
The website is already online.

67
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,920
This website is called

68
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,920
the National Assembly of the Republic of China

69
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,920
Legislative Yuan information database.

70
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,920
I will explain it.

71
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,920
This is the website.

72
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,920
You can see these things

73
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,920
when you search here.

74
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,920
If you click on

75
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,920
find a legislator, you can see

76
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,920
some of the legislators.

77
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,920
For example, Dr. Wu has six videos

78
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,920
and four news.

79
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,920
Of course, our protagonist today,

80
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,920
you can see what kind of videos

81
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,920
he has already shown on it.

82
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,920
This is all from the time we were established

83
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,920
in February last year until now.

84
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,920
We have more than 100 volunteers

85
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,920
who have moved the IBO data out

86
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,920
and posted it.

87
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,920
Some of the people who found the meme

88
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,920
may be the host,

89
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,920
some may be the news record.

90
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,920
Logging in is actually very simple.

91
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,920
The website is already written,

92
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,920
so you can log in with FB

93
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,920
and Google.

94
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,920
After logging in, you can report

95
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,920
videos, news, or inquiries.

96
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,920
One thing I want to point out here

97
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,920
is that we still need a lot of people

98
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,920
to help us

99
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,920
to promote our website.

100
00:03:51,920 --> 00:04:17,920
Thank you.
