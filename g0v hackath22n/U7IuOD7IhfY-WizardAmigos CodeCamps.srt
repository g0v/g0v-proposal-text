1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So I'm Alex, and this is Nina.

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We are from Germany, from Berlin.

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We arrived in the end of October, and we had now been waiting for actually this

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and we had some time, and in the meantime we tried to adapt a project that we

5
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
already started in Berlin to Taiwan.

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We were also inspired by saying that democracy needs more programmers or

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
hackers, developers, of course lots of engaged people in general.

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So we thought maybe we can do something about it, and we researched a bit of

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Taiwan, and I hope I'm not completely off, but we figured out that from the

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
hardware that was traditionally going on here, lots of stuff goes to China and

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
maybe Vietnam, and we read a lot that maybe software could be a solution,

12
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
so that it should be more service-oriented.

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And we figured also out that in general, in the world, a lot of programming

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
jobs or computer science-related jobs open, and there's not enough people to

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
follow these job openings, and we also found some statistics on Taiwan.

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Like here it says, for example, this was three years ago, so how many job

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
openings and how many people come to fill these positions, and now how it's

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
today.

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So yeah, a few more people now are there, but the demand grows faster.

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So yeah, we thought maybe we can do something about it.

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So we thought, okay, maybe we know some JavaScript, and we already started a

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
little school in Germany for the refugees, and also we tried with some kids,

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
and now we have open source and for free, and maybe we can adapt this to teach

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
people maybe to use the software to make something on top of the hardware,

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
because this is already present in Taiwan.

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And then we thought, okay, what could be the model?

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So we checked in the US and Canada, there's a lot of boot camps popping up

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
everywhere, and they're like 138% market growth.

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And now in the US there's like 91 full-time boot camps, and the average

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
cost, that's the problem, because it would not be for everyone, would be like

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
around $11,000 in it for 30 weeks.

32
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So translated from the average salary in the States to the average salary in

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Taiwan, this would be an average tuition of $2,500 in US dollars in Taiwan.

34
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So we thought, okay, let's create something, and because JavaScript is

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
kind of growing so fast, and there's like a huge ecosystem of reusable little

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
models that maybe can be combined to make it easier to build some stuff fast

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
by reusing open source code that already exists.

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So we started actually on the 2nd of this month, making like every day,

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
not every day, like not on Thursdays, making, can you go back?

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So making like all these boot camps, like every day from 7 to 11, we had like

41
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
a little free coding lessons, and people just came, and these are just some

42
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
pictures from some of the events that we had now a lot in the last 2 weeks,

43
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
or 2 and a half, and so all this stuff is open source and it's online.

44
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So we had like back in Berlin this alpha version, which was just we put it

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
together somehow, it's still visible on wizardamigos.com.

46
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Oh, okay.

47
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So we need collaborators.

48
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yeah, we need collaborators.

49
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I didn't get it.

50
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Okay, so...

51
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yeah, please come and ask us if you're interested.

52
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Thanks.

53
00:04:38,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Thank you.
