Hello everyone, I'm Lin Shu-Zheng.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We are a group of environmentalists who are concerned about the environment.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We have some ideas in the work stage.

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We are mainly concerned about the green infrastructure in the geographical map.

5
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We want to add more on the ground.

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So based on this motivation, we started this project.

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The main problem is that the quality of the land in the park in Taiwan's legal plan has some differences.

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Generally, when used, we can't detect the difference in quality.

9
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:31,000
These are our communication audits around the local government areas.

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Part of the cuts Valve made has been raised.

11
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Victoria Youtuber is going to reduce the rules and regulations of implementingено general planning of the 18.

12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,240
encrypting platform.

13
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,240
and the information flow can be a little bit restrained.

14
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,240
Here, for example, in Taipei,

15
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,240
we use the way of micro-imaging to process

16
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,240
the extraction of information on the surface.

17
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,240
We use the tool called direct-to-direct index NDI

18
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,240
to make a point of entry for analysis.

19
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,240
Here you can see that the black part is the more complex area,

20
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,240
and the white part is where the stone is growing.

21
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,240
Today we use micro-imaging to do time-shifting,

22
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:31,240
which can analyze the quality of the green land.

23
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,240
We hope to...

24
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:42,240
We hope to make a hard grasp of the quality of the green land.

25
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:48,240
Through these three steps, we hope to reveal the information of the green land.

26
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,240
Including the image extraction and the space-time ratio of the land.

27
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:57,240
What kind of label should be used to define the quality of the land?

28
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,240
And then we will continue to reveal the information.

29
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,240
These things include the space-time ratio,

30
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,240
which is a key point.

31
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:09,240
How to grasp and form a basic choice for the back office to have a dialogue

32
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,240
is a key point.

33
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,240
Let me talk about the last part.

34
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,240
Here we use the optical image to make a case,

35
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,240
to make a situation of the information.

36
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,240
The green part is the green area in the middle.

37
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,240
It is not the green area of the plan,

38
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,240
but the green area of the plan.

39
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,240
Tell me quickly what kind of people you want to seek.

40
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,240
We don't have time.

41
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,240
We need two people,

42
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,240
including the design and design talent of the narrative website.

43
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:53,240
And the people who design the landscape with the ecosystem as the starting point.

44
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,240
I hope you can invite the latter half to join us.

45
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,240
Do we need people who grasp the information?

46
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,240
Yes.

47
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,240
We need both the front and back.

48
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,240
Thank you.
