1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm a French journalist.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,400
We are working together on a very short web documentary

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,760
for French television, TV Saint-Monde.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,120
And we're here just to, well, to film a little bit,

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,960
to see how it goes here.

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,160
If there's anyone who doesn't want to be filmed,

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,600
please let us know.

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,440
That's no problem.

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,320
In that case, we won't use the footage.

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,960
We'll probably going to do some interviews as well.

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,120
But it'll be very short, very quick,

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,600
because it's a really tiny documentary.

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,520
We already met Audrey Tang as well,

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,920
who told us about the hackathon.

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,160
Sarah was part of the hackathon already in Paris once,

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,000
last year.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,920
Last year, yeah.

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,360
Yeah.

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,720
So, that's it.

20
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,240
So feel free to talk to us.

21
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,480
We're happy to get to know you guys.

22
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,320
Yeah, thanks.

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,400
I'll translate.

24
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,960
So, they're French journalists,

25
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,760
and they want to make a documentary.

26
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,360
If there's anyone who doesn't want to be filmed,

27
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,200
please raise your hand.

28
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,080
And we'll probably,

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,880
we'll make a sign or something,

30
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,720
and say, don't film.

31
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,800
Just some water.

32
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,360
I'll go stand over there.

33
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,200
Anyone?

34
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,040
Me?

35
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,880
No.

36
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,720
Me, me.

37
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,560
Okay.

38
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,360
And they already interviewed Audrey Tang,

39
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,840
and we'll probably have some short interviews.

40
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,240
We encourage open source,

41
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,480
but we don't force you to do that.

42
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,560
If you can release your footage as open source,

43
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,560
that's fine.

44
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,960
All right, it'll be online.

45
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,000
We'll send you the link.

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,600
There's no problem at all.

47
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,440
Yeah.

48
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,640
So just to let you know guys,

49
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,720
that it's really short,

50
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,640
so don't be disappointed that it's not half an hour,

51
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,560
but it's just two minutes.

52
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,400
I'm sorry.

53
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,960
I'm sorry for speaking so much.

54
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,560
The translation was complicated.

55
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,360
Thank you very much.

56
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:24,360
Thank you.
