1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Okay, cool. So hi everyone, we are Zero Archive.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hi.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Okay, so Zero Archive is a mission to create a public archive that is storing information.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
People in Taiwan are getting in touch on a regular basis.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So we are collecting news reporting from mainstream news websites, videos from YouTube channels, articles from content farms, etc.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So as information is a very broad term, we are focusing our political related information right now.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:55,000
One of our goals of collecting this information is to study the manipulation of information that targets at our democratic institutions and public opinions.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So what can we do with Zero Archive's data?

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Here are some of our initial proposals and we are also looking for people's input.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
First, we could develop automated evaluation of information quality to serve as a tool for the general public.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It will also be interesting to see how that quality and kind of information interacts with major events in the society.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We would also like to establish the traceability of information, especially misinformation.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:35,000
For example, where does some information start from and how does that travel from source to people's chat group, for example, inline.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So some disclosure of our project.

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:49,000
First of all, this is a funded project, but we have not disclosed our fiscal funders yet because we are still evaluating the possible consequences.

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
As we have updates, we will let the community know.

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Secondly, as we are scraping website content, we are not entirely sure of the potential copyright issues and legal concerns.

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
This is something that we are still researching.

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Today we are releasing two data sets.

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:38,000
One is a publication.

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Okay.

22
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Thank you.

23
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Okay.

24
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Thank you.

25
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Okay.

26
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Then, so who will get the pit master's badge for Wenyi now?

27
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The Pomi? Okay.
