Our project name is Data Public. As you know, it's a hunched feeling.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Data Public is a raw data archive for critical social issues or public social issues.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Actually, we surround ourselves with tons of information and data, but we don't believe it is true or correct.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So we are just searching for the raw data. If we know the raw data, we can trust each other,

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and we can know exactly what is wrong, what is correct, and what is critical. That's why we do Data Public.

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Data Public is very simple. You click here, and you can see this page.

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You choose this, and you can log in. It's just email and password. That's all.

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You're a simple editor and getting raw data.

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
In the presentation, you can see the guide on how to use Data Public.

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We don't have time, but I will show you our vision. Some people say that searching for information or data is like googling or searching for news.

13
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
But we hope that you are the first staff to enter Data Public and see the raw data.

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We believe that we want to make a vision or a dream come true.

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Do you believe that it's important to correct public data to make people trust each other?

16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
