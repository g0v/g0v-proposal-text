1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
We are going to make an open data portal in Hong Kong.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:11,200
So to start with, we actually have very small different communities in Hong Kong

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:20,000
that are gathering all kinds of shops and things in different segments of districts in Hong Kong.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,900
So we have spreadsheets and maps, these kinds of data,

5
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,600
but they are all spread out in all different kinds of communities.

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:36,100
So I want to make a united portal, something like that,

7
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:50,400
to deduplicate and gather around, and most importantly, to weight them.

8
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,100
Because we don't know who to trust in Hong Kong, honestly.

9
00:00:54,100 --> 00:01:01,500
So by weighting them, we could get a grip on what could be trusted on what scale of it,

10
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,200
and then we would publicly publish it on the internet.

11
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,700
So what currently we have is the cooperation from shops,

12
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:21,400
that we have a few dozen shops that promise to collaborate around to provide support on the list,

13
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:28,400
and also from the community to provide listings of what data they have gathered around,

14
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:36,400
and all few partners like me that has the power to do things like this.

15
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:44,500
So I want to say that because of this tool, when it's born,

16
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:49,100
it could be utilized by our enemies to attack us.

17
00:01:49,100 --> 00:02:02,100
So it would not be a thing to study in this hackathon on how to counterattack it.

18
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:12,900
So what I wish is to lower the participate barrier to anonymize how we could have submitted data,

19
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:19,600
and the standardized data format is very important for us to make a database,

20
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,500
so that it could bore in our scheme or something like that.

21
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:29,200
And also a reasonable weighting standard,

22
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,900
so that people had an open standard to see why this shop is weighted like this.

23
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:42,900
And finally, if possible, we would like to lock it in blockchain,

24
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:49,100
so that the immutable attribute could contribute like that.

25
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:55,500
So these guys I'm looking for today, so hopefully I could encounter some of you.

26
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:08,500
Thank you.
