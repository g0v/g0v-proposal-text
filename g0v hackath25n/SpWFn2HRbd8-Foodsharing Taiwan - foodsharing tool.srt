00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm Stefan from Food Sharing Taiwan, which actually is a project to fight food waste

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:16,000
in Taiwan through enabling people to share food peer-to-peer, to have co-operations,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
to organize co-operations with food retailers and also to set up public fridges all over

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Taiwan.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So far we have a Facebook group and also there's already some reports about us.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So the concept originally is from Germany, where we have this very nice website, which

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
includes a map.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So the map actually is used to show people where food is available.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So if people want to share food, they can just put it on the map and also when stores

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
want to share food, they also can put it on a map.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So everything basically is organized through this map.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The only problem is that so far this website just exists in German language.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So as the concept of food sharing becomes more and more popular in other languages,

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
there's now people working on a food-saving worldwide website, like a multi-language website,

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
which you can find on foodsaving.world.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So it already exists and it also has this map function.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It is actually open source and it will be coded live and shared on GitHub.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So I'm basically here to spread the word about this project.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So the code and everything is on GitHub.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So for us it's just important to find some more people who might want to help work on

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
this project, like programmers, developers and coders.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So we even have a blog, which is always up to date and informing about the progress of

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
the actual status of this website.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And we also have a food-saving roadmap, where we already basically have an idea what will

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
be the next releases and steps.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So if there's anybody here who might be interested in contributing to this project,

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:29,000
you can just contact us through our Facebook page, Foodsharing Taiwan,

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
or you can just send an email to foodsharingtaiwan at gmail.com.

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Or actually we are also on Slack, so you can find us basically just for Unity on Slack.

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So every support is very welcome, so just get in touch with us or just talk to me or

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:03:13,000
you see me around here today.
