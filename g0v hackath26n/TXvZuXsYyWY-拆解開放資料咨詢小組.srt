00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
If you propose a project, please come forward.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hello, I'm Ronnie Wong.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Today I want to propose a project called

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Disassembling Open Data Consulting Group.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
What is Open Data Consulting Group?

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Open Data Consulting Group is a group that has been

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
pushing open data for several years.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We have established a method for

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
the Open Data Consulting Group.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
All the second-level ministries,

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
such as the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Foreign Affairs,

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and the Cabinet, all need an

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Open Data Consulting Group.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
There are several key points in the Open Data Consulting Group.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
First, in the past,

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
every season, there was a meeting.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This year, we are changing to hold a meeting every six months.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The number of members of the group

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
cannot be less than one-third.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The group will also

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
discuss the Open Data

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
for the next issue.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The group may propose some ideas

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
on how to deal with the open data.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Or if the group has any demands,

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
the government may think that

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
the group is not suitable for public discussion.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The government must propose

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
why the group cannot be public

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and persuade the members of the group

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
to tell the public why the group cannot be public.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It sounds like a perfect group.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
However,

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
the members of the group

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
announced by the Executive Committee

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
include a procurator

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and two retired civil servants

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
from the Executive Committee.

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
They are the representatives of the public.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
They have a consensus

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
in the meeting.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
They are not so private.

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Some of the groups

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
have never held a meeting

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
because the Executive Committee

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
has no established way to hold a meeting.

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What is the purpose of this proposal?

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It is to disassemble the group.

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
This group

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
includes all the second-level groups.

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We will open a Google

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
calculation table for the second-level groups.

53
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We will organize the meetings

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and decide who has more meetings

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and who has less meetings.

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We will add a label for each member

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and tell them what kind of member

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
they are.

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
We will analyze

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
the proportion of members

61
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
in each group.

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This is the proposal.

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Let's disassemble

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:52,000
the Open Data Consultation Group.
