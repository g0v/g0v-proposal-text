00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm sorry my Mandarin is poor, I have to do it in proper English.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Not really proper, just to introduce ourselves and to tell you who we are.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
My name is Karl, this is my colleague Jerome.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm from, always from the UK, from London, from BBC,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm a technology programmer in the UK.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm spending a week here in Taiwan, humbly learning about democracy,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and how the era of the other side of the world, of our own vote,

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
is actually being revitalised and reformed and countered.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So we're here to try and understand how you all make it,

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
obviously, in the 21st century, the way that we've been doing it,

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
combining both the top-down technology and the new way of doing it,

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and then we'll go back to the US and the European way of doing it,

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
making it a country that will be on, well, including all of you,

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
so on the Italian and the Taiwanese companies,

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and Kodal, and JOIN, and VITA1,

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and really just trying to understand how we can learn,

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
what you're doing here, to try and make our own country,

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
into the 21st century, the next generation.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So, thanks so much, I hope that we can speak to you over the next few hours,

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and we've got so much coming up, and it's been hugely welcoming,

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and I'm really pleased to be here today, and I look forward to meeting you all,

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and I hope you'll join us for the rest of the day.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:53,000
APPLAUSE
