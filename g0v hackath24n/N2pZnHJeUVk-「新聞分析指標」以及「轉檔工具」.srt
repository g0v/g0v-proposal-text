1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'd like to talk about the news bulletin I mentioned earlier.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Some categories were organized in the Hyperlink.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The above is the whole thing.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
If you're interested, you can find it.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'll talk about news analysis today.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I said pearls.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's just some information.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What I'm worried about most is

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
that people will make a bunch of information into a bunch of pearls.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Otherwise, it won't be easy to get.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'll talk about a few categories.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
For example, there are PHP and JS.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
They are related to quality.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I know a little about journalism, but it's not necessary.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I've taken a few classes, but I don't know much.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
For example, I've sorted the page.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
This is a small part of it.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
For example, the title says this.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You have to make a list of things that say this.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Which day, which brand says this.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
There are a few titles that say this.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
For example, statistics.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
News thief.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
This is designed by Roni.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
There are a lot of archives.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
How many news articles are there in a day?

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I don't know.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I hope I can solve this problem.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
These words,

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
they are all strange symbols.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
They are all lies.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The archives are here.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
They are all downloaded.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
A teacher in Taichung

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
sorted 28 analysis indicators for us last year.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
They are all on the Internet.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We can do more detailed sorting.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I said it's pearls.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I see it as pearls.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
In other eyes, I see it as mud.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
A pile of mud.

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
What we are doing here

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
is a left-handed gun.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We don't want to make tanks.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
We want to make a left-handed gun.

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We want to make it with a single bullet.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
At least we have a weapon.

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Thank you.
